## Requirements:

Adding Tasks: Users should be able to add tasks to the to-do list. Each task should have a title and an optional due date.

Listing Tasks: Users should be able to list all the tasks in the to-do list. The list should display the task title and due date (if provided).

Marking Tasks as Completed: Users should be able to mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from uncompleted tasks in the list.

Removing Tasks: Users should be able to remove tasks from the list.

Persistence: The to-do list should be stored in a file so that tasks are not lost when the script exits. When the script is run again, it should load the previous tasks from the file.

User-Friendly Interface: The script should provide a user-friendly menu-driven interface for users to perform these actions.

These requirements provide a basic structure for your "To-Do List" shell script project. You can start by implementing these features and then consider adding additional features or improving the user interface based on your preferences and skills.
